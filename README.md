# sheets-micro-frontend
this is a proof of concept meant to present the sheets-micro service and phone intake. while they are close source, i hope to open them soon

# purpose
this is meant to show iphone inventory prices that link with an intake system that update nearly instantaneously, while a google sheet holds pricing information about iphone prices.<br>
this is great for enterprise solutions for buy and sell which requires fast intake and inventory to frontend. therefore this service was created.<br>
if it succeeds, more will be updated

# use
1. paste your sheets-micro url
2. in your environment variables for sheets-micro, paste in the API-KEY
3. type in the iPhone model you would like with the carrier and condition (i just realized I forgot storage)
4. query

# note
not all iPhones have images since I am just pulling off a random website with iPhone pictures, so if the way the query doesn't work doesn't work, it isn't really that big<br>
it should work for iPhone 13 <- typed verbatim

if you are a buy and sell iphone shop, i would love to get in contact with you. i offer a multitude of enterprise solutions that i can best tailor for your needs.<br>
